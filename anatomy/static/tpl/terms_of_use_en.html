<h1>PracticeAnatomy.com Terms and Conditions of use </h1>
<p>Effective as of October 22, 2016</p>
<p>Hello, and welcome to our Terms and Conditions of Use. This is important and affects your legal rights, so please read them and our Privacy Policy and other terms referenced in this document carefully.</p>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Thanks for choosing Practice Anatomy (“PracticeAnatomy”, “PracticeAnatomy.com”, “PA”, “we”, “us”, “our”). By signing up or otherwise using the PracticeAnatomy service, websites, and software applications (together, the “PracticeAnatomy Service” or “Service”), or accessing any content or material that is made available by PracticeAnatomy through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with the Marek Cierny entity indicated at the bottom of this document (“our Company”).</p>
<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”) and our Privacy Policy. (The Terms, Privacy Policy, and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section, are referred to together as the “Agreements”.) If you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the effective version of the Agreements can be found on PracticeAnatomy’s website. You acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them. If you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the PracticeAnatomy Service or consume any Content.</p>
<p>Please read the Agreements carefully. They cover important information about PracticeAnatomy Services provided to you and any charges, taxes, and fees we bill you. The Agreements include information about future changes to the Agreements, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, and privacy information.</p>
<p>In order to use the PracticeAnatomy Service and access the Content, you need to (1) be 18 or older, or be 13 or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements (except as set forth in the chart below), (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) be resident in a country where the Service is available. You also promise that any registration information that you submit to PracticeAnatomy is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.</p>
<h2>2 Changes to the Agreements</h2>
<p>Occasionally we may, in our discretion, make changes to the Agreements. When we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email. In some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes. Please therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully. If you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate the Agreements by contacting us.</p>
<h2>3 Enjoying Practice Anatomy</h2>
<h3>3.1 Our Services & Paid Subscriptions</h3>
<p>We provide the service of practicing, teaching and delivering of educational and other content. Certain Practice Anatomy services are provided to you free-of-charge. Other Practice Anatomy services require payment before you can access them. The Practice Anatomy services that may be accessed after payment are currently referred to as the “Premium Service”, “Premium Content” and the “Unlimited Service” (together, the “Paid Subscriptions”). The Practice Anatomy service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service”. You can learn more about our services by visiting our website.</p>

<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users. We will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services. If you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service. Note that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.</p>
<h3>3.2 Codes and other pre-paid offers</h3>
<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Practice Anatomy for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.</p>
<h3>3.3 Trials</h3>
<p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”). Practice Anatomy reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial, and, subject to applicable laws, to withdraw or to modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the greatest extent permitted under the law.</p>
<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. AT THE END OF SUCH TRIALS, WE MAY AUTOMATICALLY START TO CHARGE YOU FOR THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION ON THE FIRST DAY FOLLOWING THE END OF THE TRIAL, ON A RECURRING MONTHLY BASIS. BY PROVIDING YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TRIAL, YOU AGREE TO THIS CHARGE USING SUCH PAYMENT DETAILS. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE CHARGED ON A RECURRING BASIS, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH YOUR PRACTICE ANATOMY ACCOUNT’S SUBSCRIPTION PAGE OR TERMINATE YOUR PRACTICE ANATOMY ACCOUNT BEFORE THE END OF THE RECURRING PERIOD. PAID SUBSCRIPTIONS CANNOT BE TERMINATED BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, SPOTIFY WILL NOT REFUND ANY FEES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID. THE LIMITATION SECTION SETS FORTH ADDITIONAL TERMS REGARDING CANCELLATION OF YOUR PAID SUBSCRIPTION.</p>

<h2>9 Service limitations and modifications</h2>
<p>Practice Anatomy will make reasonable efforts to keep the Practice Anatomy Service operational. However, certain technical difficulties or maintenance may, from time to time, result in temporary interruptions. To the extent permissible under applicable law, Practice Anatomy reserves the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the Practice Anatomy Service, with or without notice, all without liability to you, except where prohibited by law, for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the Practice Anatomy Service or any function or feature thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have prepaid fees for Paid Subscriptions that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of the Pre-Paid Period (defined in the Payments, cancellations, and cooling off section), Practice Anatomy will refund you the an appropriate part of prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation. You understand, agree, and accept that Practice Anatomy has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Service. This section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law. Spotify and/or the owners of any Content may, from time to time, remove any such Content without notice to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
<h2>10 Payments, cancellations, cooling off, and </h2>
<p>Paid Subscriptions can be purchased by pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”). The payment is due before starting the use of the service. Your paid subscription will be automatically terminated at the end of you pre-paid period.</p>
<p>When you register for a Paid Subscription, Trial, or Code online, you consent to get access to Spotify Premium immediately. If you register for a Paid Subscription or Code online, you may change your mind, cancel your order, for any or no reason and receive a full refund of all monies paid within fourteen (14) days (the “Cooling-off Period”). Refunds will not, however, be provided if you have accessed more than 10 Practice Anatomy questions or images at any time during the Cooling-off Period.</p>
<p>When the pre-paid subscription terminates, you will be downgraded to the Free Service. However, if you cancel your payment or Paid Subscription and/or terminate any of the Agreements (1) after you have accessed Spotify during the Cooling-off Period, or (2) after the Cooling-off Period is over (where applicable), or (3) before the end of the current subscription period, we will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive a full refund of all monies paid before the Cooling-off Period is over, you must contact Customer Support.</p>
<p>Practice Anatomy may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid for), or Codes from time to time, and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes for Paid Subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Practice Anatomy Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Practice Anatomy Service prior to the price change going into effect. Please therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully.</p>
<h2>11 Term and termination</h2>
<p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Practice Anatomy. However, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual licence granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason. Practice Anatomy may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Practice Anatomy Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorised use of the Practice Anatomy Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements. If you or Practice Anatomy terminate the Agreements, or if Practice Anatomy suspends your access to the Practice Anatomy Service, you agree that Practice Anatomy shall have no liability or responsibility to you and Practice Anatomy will not refund any amounts that you have already paid, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. To learn how to terminate your Practice Anatomy account, please contact us through the Customer Service contact form which is available on our About Us page. This section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law. You may terminate the Agreements at any time.</p>
<p>Sections 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, a 18 as well as any other sections of the Agreements that, either explicitly or by their nature, must remain in effect even after termination of the Agreements, shall survive termination.</p>
<h2>12 Warranty and disclaimer</h2>
<p>WE ENDEAVOUR TO PROVIDE THE BEST SERVICE WE CAN, BUT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE PRACTICE ANATOMY SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITHOUT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. YOU USE THE PRACTICE ANATOMY SERVICE AT YOUR OWN RISK. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SPOTIFY AND ALL OWNERS OF THE CONTENT MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS AND DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. NEITHER SPOTIFY NOR ANY OWNER OF CONTENT WARRANTS THAT THE PRACTICE ANATOMY SERVICE IS FREE OF MALWARE OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. IN ADDITION, SPOTIFY MAKES NO REPRESENTATION NOR DOES IT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS (OR THE CONTENT THEREOF), USER CONTENT, OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT OR SERVICE ADVERTISED OR OFFERED BY A THIRD PARTY ON OR THROUGH THE PRACTICE ANATOMY SERVICE OR ANY HYPERLINKED WEBSITE, OR FEATURED IN ANY BANNER OR OTHER ADVERTISING. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT PRACTICE ANATOMY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OF THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS OR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ADVERTISED ON OR THROUGH THE PRACTICE ANATOMY SERVICE. AS WITH ANY PURCHASE OF A PRODUCT OR SERVICE THROUGH ANY MEDIUM OR IN ANY ENVIRONMENT, YOU SHOULD USE YOUR JUDGMENT AND EXERCISE CAUTION WHERE APPROPRIATE. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION WHETHER ORAL OR IN WRITING OBTAINED BY YOU FROM PRACTICE ANATOMY SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY ON BEHALF OF PRACTICE ANATOMY IN THIS REGARD. SOME ASPECTS OF THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY IN SOME JURISDICTIONS IF PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
<p>THIS DOES NOT AFFECT YOUR STATUTORY RIGHTS AS A CONSUMER.</p>
<h2>13 Limitation</h2>
<p>YOU AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY PROBLEMS OR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE PRACTICE ANATOMY SERVICE IS TO UNINSTALL ANY PRACTICE ANATOMY SOFTWARE AND TO STOP USING THE PRACTICE ANATOMY SERVICE. WHILE PRACTICE ANATOMY ACCEPTS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS OR THE CONTENT THEREOF, AND WHILE YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SUCH THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS MAY BE GOVERNED BY SEPARATE AGREEMENTS WITH SUCH THIRD PARTIES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, AS WITH RESPECT TO PRACTICE ANATOMY, FOR ANY PROBLEMS OR DISSATISFACTION WITH THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS OR THE CONTENT THEREOF, IS TO UNINSTALL AND/OR STOP USING ANY SUCH THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS.</p>
<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PRACTICE ANATOMY, ITS OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS, SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR (1) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; (2) ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS (WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT), IN ALL CASES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PRACTICE ANATOMY SERVICE, THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS, OR THIRD PARTY APPLICATION CONTENT, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER SPOTIFY HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; OR (3) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE PRACTICE ANATOMY SERVICE, THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS, OR THIRD PARTY APPLICATION CONTENT MORE THAN THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO PRACTICE ANATOMY DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS IN QUESTION, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
<p>Nothing in the Agreements removes or limits PracticeAnatomy’s liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, death or personal injury caused by its negligence, and, if required by applicable law, gross negligence. Some aspects of this section may not apply in some jurisdictions if prohibited by applicable law.</p>
<h2>14 Third party rights</h2>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that the owners of the Content and certain distributors (such as app store providers) are intended beneficiaries of the Agreements and have the right to enforce the Agreements directly against you. Other than as set out in this section, the Agreements are not intended to grant rights to anyone except you and Practice Anatomy, and in no event shall the Agreements create any third party beneficiary rights. Furthermore, the rights to terminate, rescind, or agree to any variation, waiver, or settlement of the Agreements are not subject to the consent of any other person.</p>
<h2>15 Entire agreement</h2>
<p>Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Practice Anatomy, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Practice Anatomy and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that other aspects of your use of the Practice Anatomy Service may be governed by additional agreements. That could include, for example, access to the Practice Anatomy Service as a result of a gift card or free or discounted Trials. When you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms. Some of those additional terms are listed on Practice Anatomy’s website. To the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.</p>
<h2>16 Severability and waiver</h2>
<p>Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>Any failure by Practice Anatomy or any third party beneficiary to enforce the Agreements or any provision thereof shall not waive PracticeAnatomy ’s or the applicable third party beneficiary’s right to do so.</p>
<h2>17 Assignment</h2>
<p>Practice Anatomy may assign the Agreements or any part of them, and Practice Anatomy may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements. You may not assign the Agreements or any part of them, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under the Agreements, to any third party.</p>
<h2>18 Indemnification</h2>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold Practice Anatomy harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising out of: (1) your breach of this Agreement; (2) any User Content; (3) any activity in which you engage on or through the Practice Anatomy Service; and (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.</p>
