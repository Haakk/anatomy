      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>Effective as of October 22, 2015</p>
        <p>
          Hello, and welcome to our Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy helps
          you to make informed decisions about your relationship with us, so
          please read it carefully.
        </p>
        <h2>1 Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Thanks for choosing PracticeAnatomy.com (“Practice Anatomy”,
          “PracticeAnatomy”). This is our Privacy Policy. Before getting into the
          details, we’d like to highlight some of the key principles behind it.
          These principles are important to us because we know they’re important
          to you.
        </p>
        <p>The Privacy Policy is here to do three things:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Explain the way we use information that you share with us in order to build a great product and give you a great experience with it;</li>
          <li>Ensure that you understand what information we collect with your permission, and what we do — and do not do — with it;</li>
          <li>Hold us accountable for protecting your rights and your privacy under this policy.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          All the information we collect is related to providing the Practice
          Anatomy service and its features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Broadly speaking, there are two categories of information we collect:
          1) information that we must have in order for you to use Practice
          Anatomy; and 2) information that we can use to provide additional
          features and improved learning experience if you choose to share that
          information.
        </p>
        <p>The first category includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Registration information, including your name, birth date, address, and other information you provide when you sign up for Practice Anatomy.</li>
          <li>Broad, non-specific location, which we derive from your IP address.</li>
          <li>The content you are practicing and your interactions with the Service. This allows us to personalize the educational content and suggest relevant content. You can choose whether or not to share this information with your friends, followers, or the public.</li>
          <li>Technical and sensor information necessary to operate Practice Anatomy. This includes the type of browser and device you use, data from the touchscreen, and information from your device’s accelerometer and gyroscope sensors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The second category includes information that enables us to offer you
          additional features. We never receive any of the following information
          unless you expressly choose to share it with us. It’s as simple as
          that. Here are some examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your photos: We will only access images that you specifically choose, and we will never scan or import your photo library or camera roll. This allows you to choose individual pictures to change your profile picture. You can stop sharing photos and revoke access at any time.</li>
          <li>Your contacts: We will never scan or import your contacts unless you ask us to. If you choose to do so, we will only use your contact information to help you find friends or contacts who use Practice Anatomy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The distinction between these two categories is important.
          Information in the first category is information you must provide in
          order to use Practice Anatomy. When you agree to our Privacy Policy,
          you give us the right to collect this information and use it for the
          purposes described. Information in the second category is information
          we will only collect if you explicitly give us permission to do so in
          the future. For this second category of information, we will ask for
          your permission before first accessing it, we will describe how we will
          use it if you give us permission, we will only use the information for
          the purpose we described, and you will always have the ability to
          change your mind and revoke that permission. Acceptance of our Privacy
          Policy does not mean you have granted us permission to access or use
          information in the second category; we’re just explaining to you that
          one day we might ask you for that permission.
        </p>
        <p><strong>We will be clear with you about how and when we might share information.</strong></p>
        <p>
          In some contexts, we will share certain information. For example,
          like most services, if you sign up for Practice Anatomy through a third
          party like Facebook or Google, we share some information with them and
          they share some information with us in order to enable your account.
          And we also share de-identified information with our research partners
          to help them better understand the process of learning, with marketing
          partners who help us with promotional efforts, and with advertisers.
          There also may be times when you want us to share information. For
          example, when you want to share with your friends how good anatomy
          knowledge you have...
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope this helps you to understand our privacy commitments to you.
          Now, the details await you below, but please remember that this
          Introduction is part of the Privacy Policy itself — it’s our promise to
          you. If you ever have any questions or concerns, then please let us
          know at anatom@googlegroups.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout this Privacy Policy we refer to the Practice Anatomy Service
          or the Service. These terms are defined in our <a href="/terms-of-use-{{LANGUAGE_CODE}}" scroll-top>Terms and Conditions of
          Use</a> (the “Terms and Conditions of Use”).
        </p>
        <h2>2 Key highlights of what you’re consenting to</h2>
        <p>By using or interacting with the Service, you are consenting to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>the use of cookies and other technologies;</li>
          <li>the transfer of your information outside of the country where you live;</li>
          <li>the collection, use, sharing, and other processing of your information, including for advertising-related purposes (as described in the rest of this Privacy Policy, so please keep on reading!); and</li>
          <li>the public availability of your information and the controls over such information as described in Sharing information.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In each case, you consent to the processing of data by the entities
          described in this Privacy Policy, including the Practice Anatomy
          entity, as data controller, indicated at the bottom of this document
          (collectively, “Practice Anatomy”, “we”, “us”, “our”). In the Your
          Preferences section, we describe the controls and relevant settings
          associated with your Practice Anatomy account. If you don't agree with
          the terms of this Privacy Policy, then please don't use the Service.
        </p>
        <h2>3 The information we collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect and store the following information:</p>
        <h3>3.1 Registration data</h3>
        <p>
          When you sign up for the Service, we may ask you for information such
          as your username, password, email address, date of birth, gender,
          address, education, postal code, and country. If you connect to the
          Service using credentials from a Third Party Application (as defined in
          the <a href="/terms-of-use-{{LANGUAGE_CODE}}" scroll-top>Terms and Conditions of Use</a>) (e.g., Facebook), you authorise us to
          collect your authentication information, such as your username and
          encrypted access credentials. We may also collect other information
          available on or through your Third Party Application account,
          including, for example, your name, profile picture, country, hometown,
          email address, date of birth, gender, friends’ names and profile
          pictures, and networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may also choose to voluntarily add other information to your
          profile, such as your mobile phone number and mobile service provider.
        </p>
        <h3>3.2 Usage, log data &amp; cookies</h3>
        <p>
          When you use or interact with the Service, we may use a variety of
          technologies that collect information about how the Service is accessed
          and used. This information may include:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>information about your type of subscription and your interactions with the Service, </li>
          <li>User Content (as defined in the <a href="/terms-of-use-{{LANGUAGE_CODE}}" scroll-top>Terms and Conditions of Use</a>) you post to the Service including messages you send and/or receive via the Service;</li>
          <li>technical data, which may include URL information, cookie data, your IP address, the types of devices you are using to access or connect to the Practice Anatomy Service, unique device ID, device attributes, network connection type (e.g., WiFi, 3G, LTE) and provider, network and device performance, browser type, language, information enabling digital rights management, operating system, and Practice Anatomy application version.</li>
          <li>motion-generated or orientation-generated mobile sensor data (e.g., accelerometer or gyroscope).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          You may integrate your Practice Anatomy account with Third Party
          Applications. If you do, we may receive similar information related to
          your interactions with the Service on the Third Party Application, as
          well as information about your publicly available activity on the Third
          Party Application. This includes, for example, your “Like”s and posts
          on Facebook. We may use cookies and other technologies to collect this
          information; you can learn more about such use in the section
          Information about cookies and other technologies of this Privacy
          Policy.
        </p>
        <h3>3.3 Your mobile device</h3>
        <p>
          We may provide features that rely on the use of additional
          information on your mobile device or require access to certain services
          on your mobile device that will enhance your Practice Anatomy
          experience but are not required to use the Service. (In other words,
          information that falls in the second category described in the
          Introduction to this Policy.) For example, we might allow you to upload
          photos to your profile, connect with friends. Granting us access does
          not mean you are granting us unlimited access to that information or
          that we will access specific information without your permission. To
          the contrary, for each type of information listed in this section,
          before we access this information or these features of your mobile
          device, we will ask for your permission. If you provide such
          permission, we will collect the information for the specific purposes
          explained at the time we ask for your permission. You do not have to
          give us such permission in order to use Practice Anatomy, and
          acceptance of this Privacy Policy does not mean you have granted us
          permission to access this information.
        </p>
        <h3>3.4 Payment data</h3>
        <p>
          If you sign up for a Trial (as defined in the <a href="/terms-of-use-{{LANGUAGE_CODE}}" scroll-top>Terms and Conditions of
          Use</a>), purchase any of our Paid Subscriptions (as defined in the <a href="/terms-of-use-{{LANGUAGE_CODE}}" scroll-top>Terms
          and Conditions of Use</a>), or make other purchases through the Service,
          your credit or debit card information (such as card type and expiration
          date) and other financial data that we need to process your payment may
          be collected and stored by us and/or the payment processors with which
          we work. We may also collect some limited information, such as your
          postal code, mobile number, and details of your transaction history,
          all of which are necessary to provide the Service. In addition, the
          payment processors generally provide us with some limited information
          related to you, such as a unique token that enables you to make
          additional purchases using the information they’ve stored, and your
          card’s type, expiration date, and certain digits of your card number.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you choose to pay by invoice, Practice Anatomy may need to collect
          and store additional information, like your name, date of birth, and
          phone number, and provide it to payment processors we work with to
          issue invoices, to enable credit checks and to send you invoices.
        </p>
        <p>
          BY ACCEPTING THE PRIVACY POLICY, YOU EXPRESSLY AUTHORISE Practice
          Anatomy TO USE AND SHARE WITH CERTAIN TRUSTED BUSINESS PARTNERS AND
          SERVICE PROVIDERS, WHICH MAY BE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY OF YOUR
          RESIDENCE (INCLUDING COUNTRIES WHICH DO NOT PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OF
          PROTECTION FOR THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AS THE COUNTRY OF YOUR
          RESIDENCE), THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU TO Practice Anatomy, EVEN
          IF SUCH INFORMATION IS COVERED BY LOCAL BANKING SECRECY LAWS. YOU
          ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF SHARING SUCH INFORMATION FOR
          THE PROVISION OF THE Practice Anatomy SERVICE AND ALSO AGREE THAT, BY
          ACCEPTING THIS PRIVACY POLICY, WHERE APPLICABLE AND TO THE EXTENT
          PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE YOUR RIGHTS UNDER SUCH
          BANK SECRECY LAWS WITH REGARD TO Practice Anatomy, AND ANY TRUSTED
          BUSINESS PARTNERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, WHICH MAY BE LOCATED OUTSIDE
          YOUR COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE. THIS CONSENT IS GIVEN FOR THE DURATION OF
          YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH Practice Anatomy.
        </p>
        <h3>3.5 Practice Anatomy service providers and partners</h3>
        <p>
          We may also receive information about you from our service providers
          and partners, which we use to personalise your Practice Anatomy
          experience, to measure ad quality and responses to ads, and to display
          ads that are more likely to be relevant to you. We also use this
          information as explained in the section How we use the information we
          collect below
        </p>
        <h2>4 How we use the information we collect</h2>
        <p>
          Consistent with the permissions you give us to collect the
          information, we may use the information we collect, including your
          personal information:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>to provide, personalise, and improve your experience with the Service and products, services, and advertising (including for third party products and services) made available on or outside the Service (including on other sites that you visit), for example by providing customised, personalised, or localised content, recommendations, features, and advertising on or outside of the Service;</li>
          <li>to ensure technical functionality of the Service, develop new products and services, and analyse your use of the Service, including your interaction with applications, advertising, products, and services that are made available, linked to, or offered through the Service;</li>
          <li>to communicate with you for Service-related or research purposes including via emails, notifications, text messages, or other messages, which you agree to receive;</li>
          <li>to enable and promote the Service and other services or products, either within or outside the Service, including features and content of the Service and products and services made available through the Service;</li>
          <li>to process your payment or prevent or detect fraud;</li>
          <li>to enforce this Privacy Policy, the <a href="/terms-of-use-{{LANGUAGE_CODE}}" scroll-top>Terms and Conditions of Use</a>, and any other terms that you have agreed to, including to protect the rights, property, or safety of Practice Anatomy, its users, or any other person, or the copyright-protected content of the Service;</li>
          <li>to provide you with features, information, advertising, or other content which is influenced by your location and your location in relation to other Practice Anatomy users; and</li>
          <li>as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>5 Sharing information</h2>
        <p>
          This section describes how the information collected or generated
          through your use of the Practice Anatomy service may be shared by you
          or by us.
        </p>
        <h3>5.1 Sharing by you</h3>
        <h4>5.1.1 Generally</h4>
        <p>Your name and/or username, profile picture, and your Practice Anatomy user profile will always be publicly available.</p>
        <p>
          Your activity at Practice Anatomy, correct and incorrect answers to
          any questions and other information related to your knowledge level and
          achievements are publically available in the default mode. This can be
          changed in the Preferences of your account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please remember that certain information is always publicly
          available, which means that it can be accessed by Third Party
          Applications through our APIs and developer tools. Based on your
          permissions, some additional information can be shared with Third Party
          Applications and with others through Third Party Applications. For
          example, you can use your settings to control whether your Practice
          Anatomy activity is posted to Facebook. Similarly, you may consent to
          provide Third Party Applications with access to your email address,
          subscription status, location, birthday, or similar information, upon
          their request.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may use your public information to promote the Service and to help
          others find and follow you and/or your Practice Anatomy content,
          including through Facebook and other Third Party Applications and on
          websites that embed Practice Anatomy widgets. Your information may be
          used to notify others, including within the Service, via email, and
          through Facebook and Third Party Applications, about your use of the
          Service (e.g., that you have joined Practice Anatomy or activity
          related to a Practice Anatomy profile, such as practicing a new
          content).
        </p>
        <h4>5.1.2 Third Party Applications</h4>
        <p>
          If you connect your Practice Anatomy account to a Third Party
          Application, Practice Anatomy may automatically share your activity and
          activity-related stories with that service, including the content you
          consume. You understand and agree that that such information may be
          attributed to your account on the Third Party Application and may be
          published on such service. Although this information may be
          automatically shared by default, we inform you of the controls that you
          can use to limit the sharing of this information in the section Your
          preferences below. The Third Party Application may also provide similar
          controls.
        </p>
        <p>
          You understand and agree that a Third Party Application’s use of
          information collected from you (or as authorised by you) is governed by
          the Third Party Application’s privacy policies and your settings on the
          relevant service, and PracticeAnatomy’s use of such information is
          governed by this Privacy Policy and your Practice Anatomy account
          settings.
        </p>
        <h3>5.2 Sharing by Practice Anatomy</h3>
        <h4>5.2.1 Marketing and advertising</h4>
        <p>
          We may share information with advertising partners in order to send
          you promotional communications about Practice Anatomy or to show you
          more tailored content, including relevant advertising for products and
          services that may be of interest to you, and to understand how users
          interact with advertisements. The information we share is in a
          de-identified format (for example, through the use of hashing) that
          does not personally identify you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please see the section Information about cookies, other technologies,
          and third-party data collection below for information about the
          cookies and other technologies that we and third parties use to serve
          you more relevant ads and your options.
        </p>
        <h4>5.2.2 Service providers and others</h4>
        <p>
          We may from time to time share your information with service
          providers to perform functions and process user data and help provide
          our Services, consistent with this Privacy Policy. For example, we work
          with data specialists analyzing learning efficiency and attractivity of
          content and analytics providers to help us understand the use of our
          Services. Where a third party processes user data on our behalf (e.g.,
          a hosting service provider), it is subject to security and
          confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and
          applicable law. Where a third party processes user data on its own
          behalf, its processing is subject to its own Privacy Policy and
          applicable law.
        </p>
        <h4>5.2.3 Rights holders</h4>
        <p>
          The Practice Anatomy service allows you to view to fully-licensed
          streaming content. Practice Anatomy shares information with the
          rights holders that license this content to Practice Anatomy. The
          data that Practice Anatomy shares is in a de-identified format that
          does not identify you directly, unless you opt in to the sharing of
          your personal information.
        </p>
        <h4>5.2.4 Other sharing</h4>
        <p>
          In addition to the above, we may also share your information with
          third parties for these limited purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>to allow a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets;</li>
          <li>to respond to legal process (e.g., a court order or subpoena), if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to do so; to comply with requirements of mandatory applicable law; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the rights and property of Practice Anatomy, including to enforce the <a href="/terms-of-use-{{LANGUAGE_CODE}}" scroll-top>Terms and Conditions of Use</a> and any other terms that you have agreed to; and to address fraud, security, or technical issues;</li>
          <li>to academic researchers for purposes including statistical analysis and academic study;</li>
          <li>to publish de-identified or aggregate information about the use of the Practice Anatomy Service.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>6 Your preferences</h2>
        <p>
          We provide you with settings to allow you to choose which
          communications you receive from us, manage your public information, and
          set your sharing preferences. However, certain information may always
          be publicly available to others and other information is made publicly
          available to others by default. And if you share information to a Third
          Party Application, that information is viewable on Practice Anatomy,
          regardless of how you set your privacy settings.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
          Information that is publicly available, may be used, re-shared, or
          linked to by others on the Service or across the web, so please use
          Practice Anatomy carefully and be mindful of your settings. Also keep
          in mind that information added to your profile may include personal

        <h2>7 Transfer to other countries</h2>
        <p>
          Practice Anatomy transfers, processes and stores information about
          our users on servers located in Czech republic. Practice Anatomy may
          also subcontract processing to, or share your information with, third
          parties located in countries other than your home country. Your
          personal information may therefore be subject to privacy laws that are
          different from those in your country of residence. Information
          collected within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and Switzerland
          may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties
          identified above, located in a country outside of the EEA and
          Switzerland, where you may have fewer legal rights in relation to your
          information. We will process your information as described in this
          Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h2>8 Links</h2>
        <p>
          We may display advertisements from third parties and other content
          that links to third party websites. We cannot control or be held
          responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content. Please
          read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process
          your personal information.
        </p>
        <h2>9 Security</h2>
        <p>
          We are committed to protecting our users’ information. Your password
          protects your user account, so you should use a unique and strong
          password, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after
          having used the Service. While we take data protection precautions, no
          security measures are completely secure, and we do not guarantee the
          security of user information.
        </p>
        <h2>10 Accessing and updating user information</h2>
        <p>
          You can view and amend much of the information we keep about you
          through your account and profile pages. If you have questions about
          your privacy on the Service, this privacy policy, or information we
          have about you, please contact us at anatom@googlegroups.com. We will
          respond to your request within a reasonable period of time upon
          verification of your identity in accordance with local laws. We
          recommend you include documents that prove your identity and a clear
          and precise description of the information which you request access to.
        </p>
        <h2>11 Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          Occasionally we may, in our discretion, make changes to the
          Agreements. When we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll
          provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the
          circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the
          Service or by sending you an email. In some cases, we will notify you
          in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes
          have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes. Please
          therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully. If you do not
          wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the
          Agreements, you may terminate the Agreements by contacting us.

        <h2>12 Information about cookies, other technologies and third-party data collection</h2>
        <p>
          This section describes use of cookies and other technologies. For
          further information about how information may be shared by Practice
          Anatomy, please see the section Sharing by Practice Anatomy.
        </p>
        <h3>12.1 What are cookies and other technologies?</h3>
        <p>
          A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer, mobile
          phone, or other device when you visit a website. The cookie will help
          website providers to recognise your device the next time you visit
          their website. There are other similar technologies such as pixel tags
          (transparent graphic images placed on a web page or in an email, which
          indicate that a page or email has been viewed), web bugs (similar to
          pixel tags), and web storage, which are used in desktop software or
          mobile devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also technologies such as mobile device identifiers and SDK
          integrations to help companies recognise your device when you return to
          an app or otherwise use the a service.
        </p>
        <h3>12.2 How we use cookies and other technologies</h3>
        <p>
          We use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web
          browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your device for a set
          period of time or until you delete them).
        </p>
        <h3>12.3 Manage your cookie and other preferences</h3>
        <p>
          Many web browsers allow you to manage your preferences. You can set
          your browser to refuse cookies or delete certain cookies. You may be
          able to manage other technologies in the same way that you manage
          cookies using your browser’s preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that if you choose to block cookies, doing so may impair
          the Service or prevent certain elements of it from functioning.
        </p>
        <p>
          We work with advertising partners to serve advertisements on the
          Service. One of the services we use to track activity related to the
          Service, e.g., by placing cookies, is Google Analytics by Google
          (Google, Inc. a company headquartered at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway,
          Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). We may use vendors, including Google,
          who use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and
          third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to
          inform, optimise, and serve ads based on your past visits to our
          websites, including Google Analytics for Display Advertising. Google
          provides tools to manage the collection and use of certain information
          by Google Analytics at <a herf="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a> and by Google
          Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network by
          using Google’s Ads Settings at <a href="https://google.com/settings/ads">https://google.com/settings/ads</a>.
